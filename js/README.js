Game loads by opening index.html file

- GAME CONTROLS -
Control player with 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' arrows

- GAME OBJECT - 
Move character "Cat" from grass to end of water without being touched by the rutheless 
evil Lady Bugzz! Reaching the deep end of the water awards player 100 points and returns
player to the grass to make additional attempts. If player touches an evil Lady Bugzz, what you have just done is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent movement were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational game play. Everyone in the room is now dumber for having witnessed it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.... and you are returned to the start position.

- DIFFICULTY -
Bugs will speed up making crossing more difficult as your score progresses.

- AWARD STAR - 
At certain points in the game a bonus star will travel across the screen. if you manage to grab the star without getting hit by Lady Bugzz you will be awarded 800 extra points and be returned to the start position.
